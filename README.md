# EDA-and-Regression-on-CO2-emissions

In this note i've considered the data set consisting of car attributes such as mileage, engine size, clinders etc and performed basic data analysis, cleaning and visualization to gain insight about the data.

Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, Numpy for high-level mathematical functions to operate on arrays, Matplotlib for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations, and Seaborn for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics,and Sklearn for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction are used in this notebook to perform the necessary functions.

Regression analysis is done for one of two purposes: To predict the value of the dependent variable for individuals for whom some information concerning the explanatory variables is available, or to estimate the effect of some explanatory variable on the dependent variable.
